The evolution of data visualization gathered pace in the late 18th century with the invention of statistical graphics.

[William Playfair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Playfair) pioneered many modern chart types 
(including line, bar, area, and pie charts) in his Commercial and Political Atlas (1786). 
His work not only transformed economic reporting 
but also demonstrated that a well‐designed chart could tell a compelling story through data.

In the 19th century, visualizations became powerful tools for public health and military strategy. 
[John Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow)'s cholera map (1854) pinpointed the source of a deadly outbreak in London, 
while [Charles Minard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard)'s famous diagram of Napoleon's Russian campaign elegantly combined six variables 
(army size, geography, time, temperature, and direction) to depict a dramatic story of loss and survival.
