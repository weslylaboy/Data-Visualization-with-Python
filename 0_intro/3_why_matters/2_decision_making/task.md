Not only does this data need to be quickly analyzed, 
but sometimes drastic measures or decisions must be based on it—and in such cases, visualization becomes crucial. 
Clear and accurate visualizations enable stakeholders 
to understand complex situations and make informed decisions quickly. 
The earlier example of a stock market treemap is a great illustration, but even in more mundane scenarios, 
dashboards are crucial for monitoring the status and availability of applications and websites.
