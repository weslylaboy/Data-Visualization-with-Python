In today’s world, the sheer volume of data being generated makes visualization more critical than ever before. 
Visualization not only helps us identify trends and patterns that might be difficult to spot in raw data, 
but it also addresses the challenge of data overload—there is simply too much raw data to comprehend it all. 
Visualizing this overwhelming volume of information is often the only way to extract meaningful insights.
