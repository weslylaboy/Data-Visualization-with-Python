Equally important, the challenge isn’t just the volume of data—it’s also its accessibility. 
People today have more access to data than ever before in history. 
This means that data must be made understandable not only to professional stakeholders 
but also to non-technical users. Take the example of the stock market: 
while it may need to be visualized in detail for CEOs and big banks, 
simpler and more straightforward visualizations are often required for individuals managing moderate investments.

Similarly, data visualization enhances political campaigning by presenting issues to voters more clearly than ever before.
