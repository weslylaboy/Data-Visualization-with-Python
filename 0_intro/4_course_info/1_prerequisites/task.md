This course is designed with no specific prerequisites.
The only requirement is a basic understanding of Python — including variables, loops, and functions.
If you're not yet familiar with Python, we recommend starting with our "[Introduction to Python](https://academy.jetbrains.com/course/16630-introduction-to-python)" course.

Throughout this course, we also use the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library for working with data.
However, prior knowledge of Pandas is not required. 
Hidden helper functions handle the data processing logic for you, 
allowing us to focus solely on data visualization.
That said, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with Pandas either before or after taking this course,
as it's widely used in the field of data science.
You can learn Pandas through our "[Gateway to Pandas](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22686-gateway-to-pandas)" course.

If you’d like to explore beyond the scope of the course,
you're welcome to write your own data processing code using Pandas.
Just keep in mind that any custom logic won’t be evaluated by the automated tests.
