The course consists of several modules, each focusing on one or two types of charts.

The first module covers line and scatter plots. 
These charts are used to explore relationships between variables,
reveal trends over time, identify outliers, and understand data distributions.

The second module introduces bar and pie charts, 
which are ideal for comparing categories and visualizing proportions within or between groups.
These charts work best when the number of categories is limited and clearly defined.

The third module focuses on histograms, which are used to examine the distribution of continuous data. 
Unlike bar charts, histograms show how values are grouped along a numeric scale. 
This makes them especially useful for identifying patterns, skewness, and density.

We recommend completing the modules in order, without skipping, 
as later modules often build on concepts introduced in earlier ones.

Each module includes an overview part, theory and practice lessons. 
In the overview, we explain when and why to use a particular type of chart, using a story from the life of Jonsi 
— a data analyst who faces many challenges in his work and life.
In the theory lessons, we explore new plotting techniques and build charts step by step. 
In the practice lessons, you’ll apply your knowledge by creating charts on your own.
