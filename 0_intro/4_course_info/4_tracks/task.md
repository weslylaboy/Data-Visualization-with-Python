In this course, we use two libraries for data visualization: [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). 
Each has its own dedicated learning track. 

If you're new to data visualization, we recommend starting with Seaborn. 
It offers a simpler API and enables you to create attractive charts with minimal effort. 
However, its customization options are limited, which can be a constraint for more advanced visualizations.

Matplotlib, on the other hand, is a more powerful and flexible library. 
It allows you to create virtually any type of chart with fine-grained control over every element. 
That said, this flexibility comes with a steeper learning curve, meaning you'll need to invest more time to achieve the desired results.

Although the two learning tracks are designed to be independent and can be completed in any order, 
we advise against taking them simultaneously. 
Focusing on one library at a time will help you build a clearer understanding and avoid confusion between the two APIs.
