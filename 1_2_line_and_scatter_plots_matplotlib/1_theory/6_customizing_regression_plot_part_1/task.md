## Theory

At first glance, the figure appears overwhelming and difficult to interpret. Let's tune the visualization parameters
a bit.

## Task

Color the line `firebrick` and set the scatter plot's transparency to `0.1`.

## Hints

<div class="hint" title="What should the figure look like?">
   <img src="example.png" alt="What the figure should look like" style="max-height: 500px">
</div>
