message_incorrect: "In graph A, most data points fall into the initial bins, indicating\
  \ a right-skewed distribution. \n\nIn graph B, the data follow a normal distribution,\
  \ which is symmetric by definition. Hence, there is no skew. \n\nIn graph C, more\
  \ data points have higher values than lower ones, indicating a left-skewed distribution.\
  \ \n\nIn graph D, the distribution is uniform, meaning there is no skew by definition. "
