## Theory

At first glance, the figure appears overwhelming and difficult to interpret.
Let's tune the visualization parameters a bit.
Since the figure above includes both scatter points and a linear plot,
we can use the `scatter_kws` and `line_kws` parameters to specify distinct settings for each type of visualization.

These parameters accept dictionaries of options 
that are passed to the corresponding plotting functions.
The already familiar `color` and `alpha` settings can be included in these dictionaries.

## Task

Color the line with the `firebrick` color and set the scatter plot's transparency to `0.1`.
