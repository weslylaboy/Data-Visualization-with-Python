## Theory

Our histogram now provides a clearer view of the distribution, but it seems to be too detailed. Using too many bins
can cause small fluctuations in the data to create a noisy appearance, making it harder to see overall trends.

The number of bins determines the balance between detail and smoothness:

- Too many bins: Reveals fine details but introduces noise.
- Too few bins: Smooths the data but may hide important patterns.
- Just right: Preserves key trends while reducing unnecessary noise.

## Task
Change the number of logarithmic bins to `50`.
