# Proportions of a whole

Pie charts are best used to show proportions or percentages of a whole.
If the goal is to emphasize the individual contribution of each category rather than directly compare categories,
a pie chart can effectively highlight those proportions.

Jonsi recently reviewed his personal finances to save for a vacation.
He used a pie chart to analyze his monthly expenses.
As expected, most of his spending went toward rent and groceries.
However, he was surprised by the substantial amount spent on entertainment, such as games and streaming subscriptions.
Realizing that he seldom used these services,
Jonsi decided to reduce these expenses, aiding his progress toward his savings goal.
