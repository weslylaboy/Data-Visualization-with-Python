# Comparison of categories

When working with discrete or qualitative variables,
bar or pie charts are effective tools for visualizing differences or similarities between categories.
They work best with a limited number of categories to prevent clutter and enhance interpretability.
If you have a large number of categories, consider grouping or summarizing them for clarity.
Bar charts are particularly useful for displaying proportions or percentages within categories,
as the scaled heights of the bars facilitate easy comparison and provide a clear visualization of the distribution.

In the early years of his career, Jonsi assisted at a local farm.
The farm had to scale back production after some of its cattle escaped.
To adapt, the farm decided to focus on producing only its most popular types of cheeses.
Jonsi organized a tasting day and used bar charts to visualize the popularity of each cheese type among participants.
His analysis effectively guided the farm’s decision on which cheeses to continue producing.
