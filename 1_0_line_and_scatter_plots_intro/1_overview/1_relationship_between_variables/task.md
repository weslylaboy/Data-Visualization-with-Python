# Relationship between variables

Both scatter plots and line plots visualize the relationship between variables, but they do it in different ways.
Scatter plots show the distribution of individual data points
and help identify patterns, correlations, clusters, or outliers.
In contrast, line plots are suitable for showing changes over time.

Let's say Jonsi is tasked with defining the relationship between variables `x` and `y`,
but he can't see the relationship by just looking at the numbers in the table.
Thus, he decides to plot them using a scatter plot.
After doing so, he notices that if he connects the points, the graph resembles a parabola.
Therefore, the relationship is likely `y = x^2`.
